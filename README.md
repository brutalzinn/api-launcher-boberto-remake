# API-LAUNCHER-BOBERTO-REMAKE

# WTF is Boberto?

Boberto is developed to be eco system to play minecraft with my friends. Its was born
 when i took  Docker api inside a Bungecoord server. [minecraft-server-dockermanager](https://github.com/brutalzinn/minecraft-server-dockermanager) and [discord-bot-vps-manager](https://github.com/brutalzinn/discord-bot-vps-manager) Soo, every year i try implement this but its just me. Many faileds and attemps to do this. At this time, exited everything that give me some disagree with myself healthcare.

 But at this time, i am using the same mindset that i used to develop Boberto to give life to more appreciable problems. This means that everything i am doing here is to develop other aspecs of mine percepcition as developer and with more professional apreciate.
